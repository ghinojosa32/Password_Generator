// I started by creating variables for each category
// then after that I created a function for the number variable to determine what would happen if a number was chosen that wasn't between the numbers given
// I created an if statement to create combinations of actions when each was clicked
// then I created a function to determine the length of the password 
//then I made it to where the password generated is pasted to the text area
// i finally added a event listener
